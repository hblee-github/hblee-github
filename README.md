- 👋 Hi, I’m @hblee-github
- 👀 I’m interested in agricultural production, food consumption, and their environmental implications, using economic theories.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning (1) the demand for food attributes linked to farm production practices and processing methods and the economic implications of agricultural policies associated with farm production practices.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on economists who have an interest in topics in agriculture and food in general.
- 📫 How to reach me is through the email: hblee@ucdavis.edu.
